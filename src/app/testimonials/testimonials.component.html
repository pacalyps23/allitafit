            <b>"</b>At first, I was hesitant to invest money in a personal trainer. I believed maybe I
            could push myself harder to achieve what I wanted. I didn’t know what
            to expect when I asked for a consultation with Alla. Forward to the present, I’ve worked with Alla for
            almost 10 months, and I’ve had amazing results. My BMI, fat, weight have
            all reduced, my posture is better, my body looks more toned. I now walk with confidence and my clothes feel
            better. Alla radiates positivity, patience, passion for physical
            training and nutrition, and with the technical savvy that gave me results. From the smallest corrections of
            proper body mechanics, and explaining objectives of an exercise,
            I got much better results with the same exercise under her guidance, as I did before I worked out with her!
            There hasn’t been a day I worked out with her, that her positivity
            wasn’t infectious. No matter what was going on that day, I left my work out smiling. She got to know me well
            enough to customize my workouts to me. She paid attention to what
            level of a challenge I required, in combination with my physical limitations (below average balance, and
            knee issues), she even customized the time of the day of our training
            schedule to my preferences. Unfortunately, she had to move, but she earns all the credit in me forming the
            healthy habit of exercising regularly, even without her.

            I’ve used multiple personal trainers in the past, and worked in a gym, and she’s the very best I’ve
            personally used and witnessed. There is no hesitation in my recommendation of Alla as a personal trainer.
            The only regret you will have is not having started training with her sooner".
